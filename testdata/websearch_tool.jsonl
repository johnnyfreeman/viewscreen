It avoids a lot of bugs related to sharing variables.(no content)Another new feature is the range over integers. The previous example can be simplified with Go 1.22 - you can now write `for i := range 10` instead of `for i := 0; i < 10; i++`.\n\n### Standard Library Additions\n\n**New math/rand/v2 Package:**\nGo 1.22 includes the first \"v2\" package in the standard library, math/rand/v2.(no content)A new math/rand/v2 package provides a cleaner, more consistent API and uses higher-quality, faster pseudo-random generation algorithms.(no content)ChaCha8 is the algorithm used for the top-level functions in math/rand/v2. As of Go 1.22, math/rand's top-level functions (when not explicitly seeded) and the Go runtime also use ChaCha8 for randomness.\n\n**Enhanced HTTP Routing:**\nThe patterns used by net/http.ServeMux now accept methods and wildcards. For example, the router accepts a pattern like GET /task/{id}/, which matches only GET requests and captures the value of the {id} segment in a map that can be accessed through Request values.\n\n**Other Library Additions:**\n- A new Null[T] type in database/sql provides a way to scan nullable columns.\n- The new function Concat concatenates multiple slices.\n- Functions that shrink the size of a slice (Delete, DeleteFunc, Compact, CompactFunc, and Replace) now zero the elements between the new length and the old length.\n\n### Performance Improvements\n\nProfile-guided Optimization (PGO) builds can now devirtualize a higher proportion of calls than previously possible. Most programs from a representative set of Go programs now see between 2 and 14% improvement at runtime from enabling PGO.(no content)The compiler now interleaves devirtualization and inlining, so interface method calls are better optimized.\n\n### Tooling Changes\n\nThe trace tool's web UI has been gently refreshed as part of the work to support the new tracer, resolving several issues and improving the readability of various sub-pages. The web UI now supports exploring traces in a thread-oriented view.(no content)go get no longer works outside a module in legacy GOPATH mode. So in case you still have a legacy project that needs GO111MODULE=off, keep this in mind.\n\n### Bootstrap Requirements\n\nAs mentioned in the Go 1.20 release notes, Go 1.22 now requires the final point release of Go 1.20 or later for bootstrap. We expect that Go 1.24 will require the final point release of Go 1.22 or later for bootstrap.\n\nFor the complete official release notes, you can visit the [Go 1.22 Release Notes](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22) page.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"227a18dc-9aca-4384-99aa-f7185cfdf904","uuid":"bcfc1c54-5e07-4cac-929f-5eec5fece6c8","tool_use_result":{"query":"Go 1.22 release notes","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01EpanKndKt29Ym7tHVewcaU","content":[{"title":"Release History - The Go Programming Language","url":"https://go.dev/doc/devel/release"},{"title":"Go 1.22 Release Notes - The Go Programming Language","url":"https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22"},{"title":"Go 1.22 is released! - The Go Programming Language","url":"https://go.dev/blog/go1.22"},{"title":"Go 1.22 interactive tour","url":"https://antonz.org/go-1-22/"},{"title":"The last article about Go 1.22 you need to read","url":"https://appliedgo.com/blog/the-last-article-about-go-1-22-you-need-to-read"},{"title":"[go] doc: start draft Go 1.22 release notes","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/golang-codereviews/c/ch8hQDtqOPo"},{"title":"doc: write release notes for Go 1.22 · Issue #61422 · golang/go","url":"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61422"},{"title":"Go 1.22 Personal Top Features.
